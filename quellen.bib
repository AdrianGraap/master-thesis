 isbn = {9780262042840},

 location = {Cambridge, Massachusetts and London},
 series = {Computer science},
 abstract = {{\textquotedbl}The book provides a technical perspective on the most contemporary data-driven approaches, focusing on techniques from supervised and unsupervised machine learning. It also includes background in the salient linguistic issues, as well as computational representations and algorithms. The first section of the book explores what can be with individual words. The second section concerns structured representations such as sequences, trees, and graphs. The third section highlights different approaches to the representation and analysis of linguistic meaning. The final section describes three of the most transformative applications of natural language processing: information extraction, machine translation, and text generation. The book describes the technical foundations of the field, including the most relevant machine learning techniques, algorithms, and linguistic representations. From these foundations, it extends to contemporary research in areas such as deep learning. Each chapter contains exercises that include paper-and-pencil analysis of the computational algorithms and linguistic issues, as well as software implementations{\textquotedbl}--},

To provide an overview and tutorial of natural language processing (NLP) and modern NLP-system design.

TARGET AUDIENCE

This tutorial targets the medical informatics generalist who has limited acquaintance with the principles behind NLP and/or limited knowledge of the current state of the art.

SCOPE

We describe the historical evolution of NLP, and summarize common NLP sub-problems in this extensive field. We then provide a synopsis of selected highlights of medical NLP efforts. After providing a brief description of common machine-learning approaches that are being used for diverse NLP sub-problems, we discuss how modern NLP architectures are designed, with a summary of the Apache Foundation's Unstructured Information Management Architecture. We finally consider possible future directions for NLP, and reflect on the possible impact of IBM Watson on the medical field.},
